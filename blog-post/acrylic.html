					<h1>My Favorite Art Mediums</h1>
					<h2> Acrylic painting</h2>
					<div class="blog-details">
						<div class="one">
							<p> Acrylic painting techniques are different styles of manipulating and working with
								polymer-based acrylic
								paints. Acrylics differ from oil paints in that they have shorter drying times and are
								soluble in water.
								Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer
								emulsion and plasticizers, silicon oils, defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps.
								Acrylic paints are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how
								much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes,
								the
								finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor, a gouache, or an oil painting, or
								have its own
								unique characteristics not attainable with other media.
								The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent
								drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over
								underpaintings. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain
								techniques,
								but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from
								regular acrylic
								paint films can be slowed with the use of acrylic retarders. Retarders are generally
								glycol or glycerin-based additives.
								The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.

							<h2>Chalk Pastel</h2>
							<p> Pastels are available in several types: hard, soft, oil, PanPastels, and pastel pencils
								-
								each with their own unique characteristics.
								This article will give you an overview of pastels so that you know what to
								consider when making a purchase. If you want to skip the introduction and see which
								brands I recommend, you can go straight to pastel types.
								There are five main types of pastels: soft, PanPastel, hard, pencil, and oil. They are
								all essentially pigment in stick form (or pans), but they differ in how they're bound
								together. Soft pastels,hard pastels,and pastel pencils are all bound with a gum or resin
								binder which
								means that they're compatible with one another and can be used on the same painting or
								drawing.
								Oil pastels, on the other hand, are bound with oil and wax, which gives them a unique
								texture similar to oil paints, but it means they can't be mixed with the other pastel
								types. Let's take a closer look at each one: Soft Pastels, Pan Pastels, Hard Pastels,
								Pastel
								Pencils, and Oil Pastels.

							<h2> Madhubani art</h2>
							<p> Madhubani painting (<i> Mithila painting </i>) was traditionally created by the women of
								various communities in theMithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from
								Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar.
								Madhubani is also a major export center of these paintings.This painting as a form of
								wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of
								painting
								on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around
								Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that led to the term "Madhubani art"
								being used alongside <q><strong> "Mithila Painting." </strong></q>
								The paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts,
								but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas.
								Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has
								remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on
								through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. Thus,
								Madhubani
								painting has received GI (Geographical Indication) status.
								Madhubani paintings use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from
								plants. Ochre, Lampblack and Red are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively.
